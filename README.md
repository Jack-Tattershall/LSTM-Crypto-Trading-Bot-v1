# LSTM-Crypto-Trading-Bot-v1
First ML Crytpo Trading Bot

# Basic Features to Train on:
- Volume diff
- Volume velocity
- Volume acceleration
- Price diff
- Price velocity
- Price acceleration 
- MACD? 
- RSI? 

# Possible Univariate Factors to Train on:
- Liquidity (Turnover Ratio, Adjusted Turnover Ratio, Amihud Ratio, FKG Ratio, Roll Spread, Effective spreads, Quoted spreads)
- Sentiment (Fear & Greed Index, Social Development History Index)
- Volatility (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio)
- Momentum (Moving Average, Rate of Change)
- Utility (Firm Profitability - Proxy ROI)
- Behavioural Bias (Peak End Value Demand)
- Overextension (Fibonacci Retracements, Ichimoku Cloud, Bollinger Band, Stochastic Oscillator)
- Market Risk (Market Factor)
- Capitalisation (Size)
 

# Immediate TODO:
- Use data directly from multiple exchanges to avoid skew and data inaccuracy
- Use Google Collab via local terminal
- Train model daily, trade daily
- Integrate TAs

# Future TODO:
- Integrate Market sentiment (Social Media Bot?)
- Ensemble ML techniques
